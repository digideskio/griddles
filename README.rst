Griddles
===========

Griddles is a simple grid system for modern responsive layouts. Free of columns it provides
percentage based-layouts with an override capability so you can determine what happens to 
the layout at given break-points by adding classes.

Supported Browsers
-------------------

Should work in the last 2 versions of all modern browsers and IE8+:

With the following notes:

Opera 12 is required for full support -as versions prior to 12 have percentage 
rounding issues so percentages based on 3rds will not render correctly.

Generated CSS
-------------

Styles are generated with SASS. The compiled src is included in the tree. If you want to 
generate the styles for yourself you will need SASS 3.2.1 as a minimum.

There's a Ubuntu PPA for this here:
